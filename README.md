# Car Parking Lot Project
                                                


## About the project:
This project is done at the completion of Object Oriented Programming Language Course i.e. C++ in order to test the coverage of the language’s basic syntax , different libraries available in C++,Class and object, operator overloading, file handling, exception handling, etc by the students.

## Features of this Program:
-	This program allows you to handle your car Parking Lot in the best possible way.
-	Offers you to keep track of  all the required info of a car parked in your lot
-	Keeps records of the info like Car Owner’s name,Car Id,entry date and time,exit date and time,and finally calculates the parking charge for you and also the bill the for you.
-	Allows you to use auto system date and time and as well as the manual date and time in case you like.
-	This program come in two different versions i.e 1st one with the facility of File Handling and the 2nd one without  File Handling.
-	The 1st version of the program allows you to store your Parking data in the File of your choice on your own system storage directory.
-	The 2nd version keeps track of the parking lot position as well i.e. tells you which car is parked in which position in the Lot.
-	This program is well secured by Login System so only the concerned personnel can interact with the Parking Data.
-	Last but not least the code for this program is well documented. So there is no need to have any further guidelines for the program. But if by chance found anything tough any get comfortably, feel free to contact me.

## Possible Enhancements:
-	The program is  unable to store the time structure data I.e System date and time in a File.
-	The login system is yet to be handled by the file handling approach.
-	Some particular syntax doesn’t work on Code::Blocks.
-	This program is Console based and hence cannot be used as GUI.


## Program Flow:
This program basically consists of the following segments.
- 1st segment(“.h”): This part of the program is actually a header file i.e. of “.h” format and it contains the code for manual date and time entry.
- 2nd segment(“.h”): This part of the program contains Date and Time Conversion algorithm.
- 3rd segment(“.h”): This part of the program contains all the initial declarations for the main class and its different arguments and  methods needed for different functionality of the program.
- 4th segment(“.h”): This part of the program contains the definitions for everthings previously declared in the segment 3rd of the program.
- 5th segment(“.cpp”): This part of the program contains the code for the version 1st i.e. with File Handling facility.
- 6th segment(“.cpp”): This final segment of contains the codes for the version 2nd of the program i.e. without File Handling Facility.
